\section{Abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Introduction: You need to (at a high level) answer the following questions, in no particular order - What do you want to do in this project? Why is this meaningful? 

\section{Design}
To achieve what you want to do (as in introduction), you took steps xyz to accomplish this. For example, if I designed a tool, what are the different components of it; if I analyzed a dataset, what steps I took to process and analyze it.

\section{Evaluation}
Depending on your design, this section could be optional. For example, if I designed a tool, I want to show in this section how effective my tool is; if I analyzed a dataset, according to my analysis, what interesting results could I get?

\section{Discussion}
This is optional. Are there anything you haven't covered in design and evaluation? Place those things here.
\section{Conclusions}
Overall, what you've learned from this project; what interesting results you've got; (optionally) what impacts have it made?
